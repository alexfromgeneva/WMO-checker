    <h4>What It Does</h4>

    <p>This new system utilizes advanced parameterization techniques for convective processes and employs sophisticated baroclinic modeling with enhanced meridional resolution. The synoptic analysis capabilities have been significantly improved.</p>

    <p>The temp data will be available through the GTS and processed by GDPFS centers. Max temperatures can reach 30 degrees in some areas.</p>
