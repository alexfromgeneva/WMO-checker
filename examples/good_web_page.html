        <h1>WMO launches global climate services initiative</h1>

        <p>The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) announced today a comprehensive initiative to strengthen climate services and early warning systems across member countries. This programme directly supports climate action and capacity development in vulnerable regions.</p>

        <h2>Enhanced monitoring capabilities</h2>

        <p>The new initiative expands the WMO Integrated Global Observing System (WIGOS) to provide better Earth system monitoring. Real-time data from weather stations and satellites will improve forecast accuracy and support disaster preparedness.</p>

        <p>National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHS) will receive technical assistance to modernize observation networks. This capacity development ensures all countries can access and use critical weather and climate information.</p>

        <h2>Supporting vulnerable communities</h2>

        <p>Early warning systems save lives by alerting communities to severe weather, floods, and droughts. The programme focuses on regions most affected by climate change, providing tools for risk reduction and adaptation planning.</p>

        <h2>Global cooperation for climate action</h2>

        <p>This initiative aligns with the Paris Agreement and supports United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) goals. International cooperation strengthens our collective response to climate change and extreme weather events.</p>
