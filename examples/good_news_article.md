# Record-breaking heat waves drive urgent call for climate action

World Meteorological Organization (WMO) released new data today showing 2025 temperatures reached historic highs across multiple continents, reinforcing the critical need for enhanced early warning systems and climate adaptation measures.

## Global temperatures soar above projections

Temperature records fell in 47 countries this year, with sustained heat waves affecting over 2 billion people. The data, collected through the WMO Integrated Global Observing System (WIGOS), provides unprecedented detail on the climate emergency.

"These findings demand immediate action," said WMO Secretary-General. "Our Earth system monitoring shows clear trends that affect every community worldwide."

## Early warnings save lives

National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHS) issued 3,200 heat warnings this summer, helping communities prepare for extreme conditions. Early warning systems proved essential for protecting vulnerable populations and reducing heat-related health impacts.

WMO's enhanced forecast capabilities now provide seven-day advance notice for heat events, giving authorities time to activate response plans.

## Supporting climate resilience

The organization strengthens capacity development programs in 50 countries, focusing on regions most vulnerable to climate change impacts. Technical assistance helps nations improve hydrometeorological services and build climate resilience.

International cooperation through WMO coordinates global efforts to monitor climate change, share data, and support climate action initiatives aligned with the Paris Agreement goals.
